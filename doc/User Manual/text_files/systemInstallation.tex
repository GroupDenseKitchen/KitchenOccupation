\subsection{Hardware}
Each Kinect camera must be installed above a door with no overlapping view shared with any other Kinect camera. The Kinect must point down or slightly angled towards the room. A minimum distance of 50 cm is required from the lense of the Kinect and the top of the door. Each Kinect must be connected to a power source, and to a device running the system software using USB.

\subsection{Software}
There are two versions of the software, one with a calibration and configuration GUI and one lightweight version without a GUI. In order for the lightweight version to work a configuration file, persumably generated by the GUI version, is required. The configuration file is best generated using the configuration program, and then copied to the system running the non-GUI variant. \\

Linux, OS-X or Windows is required on the machine running the software. At least one Kinect camera must be connected before starting the software. More than one Kinect camear is currently only working on Linux and OS-X. Some software libraires are required to compile the program, these are listed in table \ref{reqSoftware}. \\
