The system needs to be calibrated for the current installation height of the Kinect sensor. This is easily done in the Calibration Window, figure \ref{fig:Calibration}, which can be started under the \textit{System} tab in the menu bar. To the left is a thresholded depth image and to the right a histogram. The slider below the histogram adjusts the threshold level. The threshold should be set so that a "normal" personâ€™s head and shoulders are left. Press Apply to save the changes.
