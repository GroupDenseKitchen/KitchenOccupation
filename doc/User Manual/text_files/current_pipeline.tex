This section describes the image processing pipleine that is delvired with the system and that har yielded the best performance so far.

\subsection{Sensors}
After reading several papers on single camera top-down view people counting and implementing the methods described in said papers, the realization was made that, in order to be able to solve the problem described in section \ref{sec:introduction}, some form of depth information would be necessary. Both stereo and Kinect-style sensors were considered. However due to time limitations and a customer desire to run the system on cheap hardware, the Microsoft Kinect sensor was chosen.

\subsection{Image processing}
Information about the current image processing steps, thresholding etc etc.

\subsection{Tracking and counting}
Information about tracking (Kalman filter) and people counting (different area and such)

\subsection{Queue detection}
Information about: how do i detect queue?
