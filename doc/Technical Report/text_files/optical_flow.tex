In order to improve the segmentation of people, especially when they where close together, an attempt to segment different objects based on optical flow was made,
the original plan was to implement something similar to \Cite{flowpaper}. However due to the relative ammount of computation time needed to compute the optical flow in the image, 
along with the kinect version of the system performing far better the idea was scrapped before being fully realized.
