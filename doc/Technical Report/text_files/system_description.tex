\subsection{Config file system}
The system configuration file contains all image processing pipeline parameters together with the address of the current destination web service, where counting results are to be presented.

\subsection{Network module}
The network module manages all system input/output. Currently, support exists for all OpenCV-compatible RGB cameras as well as the Microsoft Kinect depth sensor. The module is designed to be as modular as possible, allowing for a relatively easy replacement integration of new sensor types. Support also exists for running several sensors in parallel. Communication with the web server also takes place here.

Algorithm interfaces and stuff

\subsection{Debug and Config GUI}
