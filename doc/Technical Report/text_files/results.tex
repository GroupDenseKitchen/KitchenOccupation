In this section the results of the project is summarized for some sequences chosen together with the other group. The sequences, as well as the ground truth used are provided by the EC Funded CAVIAR project, \cite{CAVIAR}.

\subsection{Evaluation Scores}
In table \ref{tab:evaluation_performance} below the video clips chosen for the evaluation are presented, along with the achieved accuracy measurements.
TODO: Fix table:
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
	\begin{tabular}{r | c | c | c}
		\emph{Sequence Name}		& \emph{In} & \emph{Out} & \emph{Count}\\
		\hline \hline
		training data			& 0.56 & 5.01 & 5.01 \\
		evaluation data			& 0.70 & 5.30 & 5.01 \\
		other data				& 0.65 & 5.09 & 5.01 \\
		data stuff 				& 0.90 & 5.44 & 5.01 \\
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\textit{Counting performance according to the evaluation metric as described in section \ref{sec:evaluation}.}}
