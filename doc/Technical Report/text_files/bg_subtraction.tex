A very simple solution was tried early in the project. It consisted of a Mixture of Gaussian model \cite{Gardel} used for segmenting the moving foreground from the background as a binary mask. After the segmentation, all connected moving objects were found and tracked using a simple tracker. This approach was developed and performed well for tracking people moving relatively fast, but worse or not at all for people moving slow and standing still. This approached suffered from problems such as be unable to handle common occlusions when people stand and move too close to each other, especially when doing so from entering to leaving the field of view. To detect individual persons in such situations required more advanced methods, some of which were tried, but never really tuned or good enough to perform well enough. Further improvements on this approach were therefore never implemented. The approach also required quite some morphological operations to connect loosely connected components of humans, as seen in figure \ref{fig:bg_success}, or very restrictive limits on minimum object area.\\
\\
Using a more sophisticated tracker with prediction and which remembered persons even as they became a part of the background, most problems except severe occlusions could possibly been coped with. Another solution would have been to identify humans and disallow the background model from learning those region, eliminating the disappearances of tracked persons. \\
\\
The algorithm described in \cite{Gardel} was chosen since it was the most recently developed background subtractor in OpenCV, and also the best performing one according to the OpenCV reference manual.
