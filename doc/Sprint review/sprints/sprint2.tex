\section{Review of Sprint 2}
\label{sec:sprint2}
\large Period: 2013-11-04 -- 2013-11-18 \\ 
\large Est. time: 295 hours. (Roughly 42 hours per person, meetings (6 hours per person) not included.)

\subsection{Sprint backlog}
The main focus of this sprint is to get a minimal case implementation that meet all requirements in the specification of requirements. The initials of the person responsible for each specific sprint item is shown in boldface in the rightmost column of the table.

\subsection{Backlog items from previous sprints}
These are the items created in the previous sprint that were carried over directly to this one

\subsubsection{Improve foreground segmentation}
Both performance and computation time of the foreground segmentation needs to improve in order to make it useful.
This item was created during \textbf{sprint 1} and is represented in this sprint as item number \textbf{10}.

\subsubsection{Ground truth labeling}
In order to be able to present projects result with some form of performance measurement ground truth data, as well as evaluation code has to be created.
This item was created during \textbf{sprint 1} and is represented by sprint item number \textbf{4}.
