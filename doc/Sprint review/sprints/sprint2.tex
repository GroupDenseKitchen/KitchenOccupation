\section{Review of Sprint 2}
\label{sec:sprint2}
\large Period: 2013-11-04 -- 2013-11-18 \\ 
\large Est. time: 295 hours. (Roughly 42 hours per person, meetings (6 hours per person) not included.)

\subsection{Sprint backlog}
The main focus of this sprint is to get a minimal case implementation that meet all requirements in the specification of requirements. The initials of the person responsible for each specific sprint item is shown in boldface in the rightmost column of the table.

\subsection{Backlog items from previous sprints}
These are the items created in the previous sprint that were carried over directly to this one

\subsubsection{Improve foreground segmentation}
Both performance and computation time of the foreground segmentation needs to improve in order to make it useful.
This item was created during \textbf{sprint 1} and is represented in this sprint as item number \textbf{10}.

\subsubsection{Ground truth labeling}
In order to be able to present projects result with some form of performance measurement ground truth data, as well as evaluation code has to be created.
This item was created during \textbf{sprint 1} and is represented by sprint item number \textbf{4}.

\subsection{Result}
The results from this sprint were not the ones we hoped for as five items are marked as not done, and several others are marked as not tested or have some small issues left. In total 7 out of 16 items are not finalized, which is not good enough.

\subsubsection{Solutions we ended up using}
We tried the OpenCV hough circles function with tuning, however it was not good enough for our application, meaning that we will need to implement circle detection on our own. This was also the reason item number 9 was not finished on time. The OpenCV hough circles functon was tried out on images with removed background (using the existing BackgroundModelMOG2 background subtractor.) Point descriptors for simple human classification were also evaluated without success.

\subsubsection{What did we do well?}
Several relevant papers solving the problem were found. This allowed for good re-organization of the work to both solve the new problems as well as meeting changed demands in terms of available hardware.

\subsubsection{What improvements are necessary?}
The most important improvement that needs to be made is to get better at working in parallel to try different approaches to the problem, together with prioritizing the tasks in a better way. The most important thing at the moment is to focus on the goal of the project, which is making sure it is possible to deliver a system that can count people passing under a doorway with reasonable accuracy at the time of the deadline.
