\section{Review of Sprint 1}
\label{sec:sprint0}
\large Period: 2013-09-30 -- 2013-10-14 \\ 
\large Est. time: No estimate was made

\subsection{Sprint backlog}
The main focus of this sprint is to get the simplest possible system up and running on pre-recorded test data. Unfortunately no time was available on hte planning meeting to perform time estimations, which is why no time estimates are available for the different sprint items.

{
	\additem{Collect more test data, several data sets with varying difficulties using a single camra above a rooom entrance are desired.}{--}{AS, EF}
	\additem{Label the new data (using the CAVIAR labeling program).)}{--}{AS}
	\additem{Add more data structures to the code skeleton.}{--}{GH, MT}
	\additem{Add DOxygen comments to the code skeleton.}{--}{MT}
	\additem{Load video file(s) into network module, making it possible to retrieve individual frames.}{--}{MS}
	\additem{Implement background model and segment background/foreground (Raw image in and foreground binary image mask for the pixels that are “moving” out. (Use openCV background subtractor class)}{--}{EF, NW}
	\additem{Foreground labeling. Find distinct regions in a binary image mask and describe them with position and AABB.
	Add regions as “objects” to current Frame.}{--}{EF, MS}
	\additem{Track objects in the frames using the information recieved from the foreground labeling and estimate the net flow of objects.}{--}{EF, MT}
