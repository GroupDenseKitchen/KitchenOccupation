\section{Review of Sprint \sprintnum}
\label{sec:sprint1}
\large Period: 2013-09-30 -- 2013-11-04 \\ 
\large Est. time: No estimate was made

\subsection{Sprint backlog}
The main focus of this sprint is to get the simplest possible system up and running on pre-recorded test data. Unfortunately no time was available on the planning meeting to perform time estimations, which is why no time estimates are available for the different sprint items. The ending date of this sprint was postponed 2 weeks due to exam periods, since not enough work would be made during these two weeks in order to justify an entire sprint.

\subsection{Result}
The result from this sprint is good, as all of the items except for one was finished, providing a great framework for more advances algorithms to be added. The most notable thing not finished is the net flow estimation and the fact that the system still does not run in real-time on a camera. The total amount of hours spent on specific sprint items adds up to 126 hours with meetings excluded. With meetings and technical support hours the total number of hours amount to around 200 hours.

\subsubsection{Solutions we ended up using}
Currently a mixture-of-Gaussian background model is used together with morphological erode/dilate to identify foreground regions. These regions are then tracked using a local greedy tracking algorithm. The tracking algorithm features candidate object that have to fit certain criteria (currently lifetime) in order to be considered real objects.

\subsubsection{What did we do well?}
Most of the project work was done well, especially the short meetings, which were short and effective, resulting in new problems being solved efficiently. The most important achievement completed during this sprint is the debug and algorithm platforms. The debugging program allows easy visibility and profiling of each intermediate algorithm step, together with an easy interface for implementing new algorithms in a rapid fashion. Group members have also developed their skills and are able to use the tools (mainly Github) much more efficiently than in the previous sprint, hopefully reducing the technical support hours spent by group members.

\subsubsection{What improvements are necessary?}
The most important improvement needed in the next sprint is how group members communicate when making design decision. Some unnecessary parallel work was made due to bad communication. Persons in the group with less hours worked need to spend more time working on the project. Because of this the time reporting has to improve significantly in the future.

\subsection{New Backlog Items}
This sprint resulted in a few new backlog items being created during the sprint, these items are listed below.

\subsubsection{Select video files and/or cameras from Debug GUI.}
In order to make testing easier and faster, by not having to restart the program to load a new file and/or view a new camera.

\subsubsection{Object class}
Make sure the Object class meets the code standard.
