\section{Review of Sprint 4}
\label{sec:about}
\large Period: 2013-12-02 -- 2013-12-13 \\ 
\large Est. time: ?? hours, meetings included.
\large Time spent: ?? hours, meetings included.

\subsection{Sprint backlog}
The main focus of this sprint is to put the entire system together, make a performance evaluation and create all the necessary documents. As much of the work is documentation, more work will take place in smaller groups, hence there are fewer people designated to specific items.

\subsection{Backlog items from previous sprints}
These are the items created in the previous sprints that are picked up in this one. Most of the new items were created during the previous sprint.

\subsubsection{Sprint review collection}
Provide a collection of sprint reviews that together with the spreadsheet describe the project work, result and planning. This item was created during the first sprint.

\subsubsection{Make the kinect stream live on Mac OS X}
Make it possible for the system to use the kinect sensor as an input on Mac OS X.

\subsubsection{Make the kinect stream live on Windows}
Make it possible for the system to use the kinect sensor as an input on Windows.
