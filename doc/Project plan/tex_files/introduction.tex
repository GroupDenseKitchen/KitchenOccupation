\subsection{Background}
This document is written regarding how the project Kitchen Occupation, which is part of the course TSBB11 HT 2013 at Linköping University, will be carried out. The main goal of the project is to produce a system that is capable of automatically measuring the level of usage of student kitchens at Linköping University. The project will be developed using a version of the SCRUM methodology and as such, a full blown Project Plan according to the LIPS model is not required. It is instead required that the initial Product Backlog be presented, along with an estimate of in which Sprint each Backlog Item will be completed. 

\subsection{About this document}
 This document includes the initial Product Backlog with associated Sprint timings. In addition to this, a brief overview of the changes we have made to the standard SCRUM methodology in order to make it fit into the context of the given project is presented, as well as an overview of the developement process of one sprint item.
