\subsection{Performance requirements}
The requirements listed in the table below all assume one camera per room entrance, if each camera is required to monitor more than one entrance, the type of each requirement is incremented by one (Type 1 becomes type 2 etc.).

{
	\addreq{The system is able to count the number of people entering or leaving the room, thereby knowing the number of persons currently in the room.}{1}
	\addreq{The system knows if there is a queue to enter the room}{1}
	\addreq{A rough estimate of the queue size/waiting time is presented}{1}
	\addreq{A more accurate estimate of the queue size and/or wait time is provided by using mathematical models}{2}
