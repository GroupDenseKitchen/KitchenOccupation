If no time is specified, the requirement has to be fulfilled by the time of the final delivery (see section \ref{sec:delivery}). %LÃ¤nk till sektionen med leveranskraven
	\item A requirement with priority level two is a requirement to be met if extra time is available.
	\item A level three requirement is more of a suggestion on how to improve the system even further after the final delivery.
