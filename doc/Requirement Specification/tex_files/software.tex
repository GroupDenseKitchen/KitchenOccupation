The software part of the system performs all the image processing and analysis needed to detect usage of a room. It will also be cablable of predicting future room occupancy degree based on historical usage. 

A website for the project will be published using the wordpress CMS, it will describe the prject and its participants.
 
\subsection{External dependencies}
The software is written using the OpenCV library to handle the image processing, and when possible interfacing with cameras. 
Any visualization and debugging tools are written using the Qt framework. 
An HTTP library is used to handle communication with LIUs REST API.
Cmake and any C++11 capable compiler can be used to compile the source code to a binary.

The website will be hosted on a standard LAMP stack.

\subsection{Compatibility}
The software is possible to build for most major plattforms (Windows/OS X). A REST API is used to communicate the results.

\subsection{Limitations}
For integrity reasons no personally identifiable information can be stored or reported by the system. As the processing is done on a server there is no hard limit on the computational complexity of the software.
