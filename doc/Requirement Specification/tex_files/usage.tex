This section describes what is required by the system in terms of usage and installation. It also covers what is wanted by the user. 

\subsection{Installation}
The installation consists of the placement of one or more cameras, connection of these via Ethernet to a computer, and installation of the user interface on that computer. The cameras should be placed as described in the user manual with focus on vision rather than precise positioning. The connection via Ethernet is completely provided by the user.     

Once installed the system needs a calibration which is preformed by the user in the calibration program.

The installation and calibration process is describe in detail to the user in the user manual.

\subsection{Usage}
When the system is properly installed it can be manoeuvred by the user through the interface. The user can now from the interface start grouping cameras together. These groups are bound to the different rooms which are to be supervised. Now the system will start keeping track of the rooms and continuously provide the user with occupancy statistics about the rooms. 

\subsection{Maintenance}
The system should be able to run continuously once started, without further maintenance. Additional rooms can not necessarily be added on the fly. 

\subsection{Continued development}
The user interface is initially not prioritised as this is a project mainly in computer vision. This will leave some GUI features open for future development. 

\subsection{Operational requirements}
The user is assumed to have some minor computer skills, but no knowledge whatsoever about computer vision.
