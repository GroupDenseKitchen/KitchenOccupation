

The hardware consists of network cameras connected directly by Ethernet to a processing unit. The system should be able to handle cameras with a resolution of at least 2M pixel. The cameras are connected to the processing unit a network or USB. 
The processing unit is a computer connected to one or more cameras that displays the calculated results.

\subsection{Limitations}
The hardware is limited by budget, Internet connection and the source of power. The cost is limited to approximately 15.000 SEK per room, including installation costs. The budget limits performance of the cameras e.g. resolution and number of cameras. The connection to the cameras need to be stable and have a bandwidth good enough for sending live video from the cameras.
