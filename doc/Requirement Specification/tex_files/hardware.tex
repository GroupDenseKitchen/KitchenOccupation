
Since the system is to be able to run on two different platforms, the hardware requirements differ a lot depending on which system being considered. In the case of Raspberry Pi computers being used, all cameras each have their own Raspberry Pi processing unit where image processing takes place. In case of a central image processing unit (laptop, server or desktop computer), image processing from all cameras in the room take place on this central unit.

\subsection{Limitations}
The hardware is limited by budget, Internet connection and the source of power. The cost is limited to approximately 15.000 SEK per room, including installation costs. The budget limits performance of the cameras e.g. resolution and number of cameras. The connection to the cameras need to be stable and have a bandwidth good enough for sending live video from the cameras.
